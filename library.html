<p>This document was mostly created as an attempt to keep track of my various, mostly unsuccesfull excursions in world of coding</p>
<p>One should think I would have learned to stick with what I do know how to do after few months of blundering around the coding swamps.</p>

  <p>28/11/20-Added some ramblings in the home tab after unsuccesfully tying to import external text file in a presentable and simple manner.</p>
  <br />
	<p>27/11/20-One major issue with this document is that it doesn't appear to load CSS file when opened on Android. At the moment I am too lazy to dig deeper into this and luckily there are so many other issues I can focus on so I can freely ignore this particular one.</p>

<div id="About" class="tabcontent">
  <br />
  <p><b><i>Epulon:</i></b></p>
  <br />
  <p>Part-qualified electrician, studied Mechanical Engineering for few years, dragged myself around various metal workshops, hospitality and warehouse jobs through Croatia and Ireland.</p>
  <p>Finally found interesting profession in Facade design, happily worked in it for few years before realizing that the entire construction industry is based on few expensive software packages from even fewer software companies and in order to extend my self education in the field would have to invest in fairly expensive harware to support even more expensive software.</p>
  <p>By helping out my girlfriend in her studies found out that coding is not actually so intimidating and started tinkering with some basic stuff.</p>
  <p>Sadly that realization came only after I enrolled in part-time civil engineering course and paid few thousands â‚¬ for it.</p>
  <p>So right now, I'm sitting at my laptop, listening to online lectures about is it better to use steel or polymer surveying tape, that i will most likely never use in my life, and trying not to fall asleep by keeping myself entertained developing some new skills and actually seeing results of my work as i go along.</p>
  <p>P.S. I stil consider Facade and CAD design as an extremely interesting area, just find the monopoly by few software companies a bit frustrating.</p>

  <h3 align="center"><i><u><b>Javascript</b></u></i></h3>
  <br />
  <p>First section for the most part follows <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sololearn.com/">SoloLearn's</a> tutorial on JavaScript</p>
  <br/>
  <h4><i><u>Basics</u></i></h4>
  <br/>
  <ul>
    <li>Javascript is inserted in HTML document between <span class="code">&lt;script&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;/script&gt;</span> tags.</p>
    <br/>
    <li>To get Javascript to print output within HTML document:</li>
      <p class="code">document.write("Something, something, complete.")</p>
    <br/>
    <li>For <i>web console</i> output function <span class="code">console.log()</span> is used. Example:</li>
      <p class="code">console.log("Hello console")</p>
    <br />
  	<li><i>Variables</i> are containers for storing data. <br />For example assigning value 10 to variable x</li>
  		<p class="code"> var x = 10;</p>
  </ul>
